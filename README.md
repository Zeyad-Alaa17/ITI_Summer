## Installation

download main.py file then install streamlit
```bash
pip install streamlit
```

## Usage

```bash

streamlit run main.py
```

## Notes
Lane detection algorithm needs work:


-doesn't detect curved lines and has diffculty with dark colored lanes


-shift in viewing angle might cause the algorithm to malfunction


(perhaps use deep learning or modify preprocessing pipeline for better results)
